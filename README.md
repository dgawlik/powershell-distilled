# powershell-distilled

Most of the business machines come with Windows as primary
OS. This can a bit limiting for developer used to Linux. This is my personal attempt of translating bash scripts to powershell. So far I had good fun with it.


## Trying out

Every script is self contained lesson. They are prefixed with numbers so the chapter/topic/script is exactly in order
you should read it.

## Contributing

I am happy for any contributions. PRs are all welcome.

This would be the most helpful:

* try to limit a PR to single script lesson
* adhere to to naming convention of scripts <order>_<script_name_with_underscores>
* try to avoid reordering existing lessons
* if you see an error raise issue first
* if you want to explore more in depth existing scripts
then add another script with appropirate prefix. So for example I got script 02-basics\aliases-and-printing\01_basic_printing.ps1. If you found something interesting then create 01b_basic_printing.ps1 there.
