# powershell-distilled

Most of the business machines come with Windows as primary
OS. This can a bit limiting for developer used to Linux. This is an attempt to translate common administrative tasks in Linux to Windows with use of powersell.

Powershell is not as scary as it seems at the first glance. So far I had a good fun with it... 

## Trying out

The repo is a bit unstrutured but I tried to categorieze most common tasks. This is not by all means comprehensive list so go ahead and fork it and write your own scripts.

## Contributing

I would be very happy if there were any pull requests to this repo with new tricks. I aim for it to be a comprehensive guide for Linux guys coming to windows scripting.
